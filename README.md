# CPAL Android Test

A simple test to see if my branch of CPAL works on your Android device.

The repo contains pre-built [CPALTest.apk](CPALTest.apk), which you can just install and run. It should play a simple melody till the end.

You can build the APK yourself with `cargo apk build`. That requires [cargo-apk](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk) **v0.5.2 or newer**.
